## **Using an External Editor**

The Arduino IDE editor is a bit limited, so if you want to use a different editor to modify your code, open the Arduino IDE preferences and check the 'Use External Editor' checkbox. This puts a blue tint over the code, and prevents it from being edited in the IDE. Instead, open up your preferred editor to modify your code - anytime you save in that editor, the code in the IDE should update.

**Note â€“** you will still need to use the IDE to compile and upload your code to the devices 

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is a great editor you might consider.
