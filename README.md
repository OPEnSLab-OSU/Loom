## Introduction

Loom is an ongoing multidisciplinary collaboration of the OPEnS Lab with a team of 20+ Computer Science and Electrical Engineering students to create a fully open source, modular, user friendly, sensor/actuator Arduino library and ecosystem. The project enables environmental research and conservation communities to overcome significant technical hurdles for creating new environmental, agricultural, and ecological instrumentation to measure, monitor, automate, and understand our world. 

## Objectives

- Design a "plug and play" sensor/actuator system
- Simple enough for K-12 students and non-technical users to use
- Extensible and programmable enough for engineers to customize
- Create a wide variety of applications by simply connecting modular components
- Make the system wireless, low-power, low latency
- Configure all sensors and actuators on a wireless network using an intuitive graphical user interface
- Interact with data and control signals on a network in realtime
- Make data transmitted from local and remote locations available instantly from anywhere around the world

## Key Features

- Quick to setup an entirely new project
- Code contained in an Arduino library
- System behavior defined with a configuration specification and minimal code
- Extensive customizability for complex applications
- Designed for extensibility
- Variety of sensors and actuators supported 
- Remote data logging to SD and internet in near real time

## Arduino Setup

[Arduino IDE Setup Guide](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/Loom/wiki/Arduino-Setup)

## Installing Loom

 [Loom Installation Guide](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/Loom/wiki/Loom-Installation)

## Quick Start

 [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/Loom/wiki/Quick-Start)

## Common Pin Allocations

[Common Pin Allocations](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/Loom/wiki/Common-Pin-Allocations)

## Hardware Support

[Hardware Support](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/Loom/wiki/Hardware-Support)

## Documentation

[Wiki](https://wiki.open-sensing.org/doku.php?id=loom) for general documentation not on GitHub or in Doxygen document

[Doxygen generated documentation](https://openslab-osu.github.io/Loom/html/index.html) for documentation of the code and how to use

***Note***: The documentation does not currently update automatically, if would want to be sure you have the most up to date version of the documentation, you can run Doxygen to manually generate a local copy of the documentation. See the Doxygen website on how to [Install Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html) and [Doxygen Usage](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/doxygen_usage.html). 

Once installed, the run `doxygen Doxyfile` from the command line (from Loom directory) to generate the documentation. To view, open the `Loom/html/index.html` file in a browser.
